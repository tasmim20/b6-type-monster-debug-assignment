        <h2>1.Difference between local storage between session storage??</h2>

    <ol>  
        <h3>Local Storage </h3>
        <li>The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB</li>
        <li>As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually</li>
        <li>It's session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed</li>
    </ol>
