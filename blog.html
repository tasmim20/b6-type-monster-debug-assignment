        <h2>1.Difference between local storage between session storage??</h2>

    <ol>  
        <h3>Local Storage </h3>
        <li>The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB</li>
        <li>As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually</li>
        <li>It's session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed</li>
    </ol>

  <h3>Session Storage</h3>
  <li>The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed</li>
  <li>data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends</li>

        <h2>2.Difference between global scope and block scope</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Global Scope</h3>
          <li> Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h3>Block Scope</h3>
            <li>Block Scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A block variable has block scope. A block variable is only accessible where it's declared.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3.How Javascript event loop works??</h2>
        <p>The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.</p>

        <h2>4.In how many ways you get undefined in Javascript??</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned value, is automatically assigned the value</li>
            <li>It will get undefined value when a non-existent property is being called</li>
            <li>An undefined evaluates false when used in conditional expression</li>
            <li>If it is passed less arguments in function then, that parameter will have undefined value.</li>
        </ul>
